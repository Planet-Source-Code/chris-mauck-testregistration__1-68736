### Description

The code generates a dynamic user registration KEY. It can be used like the old Microsoft style where a key is generated, then the user must call in or go to a website to get the final activation KEY based on the first. This is my first submission and it isn't even originally mine. I apologize for that and I will get some of my own original code here soon. Its about time I start paying back all of the great help I've gotten from the codes submitted here on PSC.
 
### More Info
 
I did not develop the code for this. I merely modified the concept of its use and created the user interface. The code was originally submitted to freevbcode.com by Phil Fresle in Sept of 2000.
